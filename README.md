# Web Vulnerability Scanner (W.V.S)

## Overview

**Web Vulnerability Scanner (W.V.S)** is a comprehensive tool designed to identify and report security vulnerabilities on web pages. This Python-based application scrapes specified URLs for vulnerabilities listed in a predefined table format, filters critical and high-severity issues, and generates a report. Additionally, it sends an email notification if any critical vulnerabilities are detected.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts vulnerability data from HTML tables on specified web pages.
- **Severity Filtering**: Identifies and collects vulnerabilities classified as "Critical" or "High".
- **CSV Reporting**: Saves the collected vulnerability data in a CSV file for easy review.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends an alert via email when critical vulnerabilities are detected.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
project_root/
│
├── scrape_vulnerabilities.py  # Main script for scraping vulnerabilities and sending notifications
├── Banner/
│   └── banner.py  # Script defining the banner display
├── requirements.txt  # List of Python package dependencies
└── critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv (generated by the script)  # Report of detected vulnerabilities
```

## Installation

To set up the Web Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Email Configuration

- Open the `scrape_vulnerabilities.py` file and configure your email settings. You can either set environment variables or directly input your credentials:

  ```python
  from_email = os.getenv("EMAIL_USER")  # Environment variable for email
  password = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASS")    # Environment variable for email password
  ```

- Replace `smtp.example.com` with your SMTP server’s address and port.

### Banner Customization

- Modify the `Banner/banner.py` file to update the banner text displayed when the script runs.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```sh
   python scrape_vulnerabilities.py
   ```

2. **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**

   - Enter the URLs you want to scrape.
   - Type `done` when you have finished entering URLs.

3. **Review the Report:**

   - Check the `critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv` file for the list of detected critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.

4. **Email Notifications:**

   - If critical vulnerabilities are found, an email notification will be sent to the recipient specified in the script.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to web pages.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
- `pandas`: For handling and exporting data to CSV format.
- `termcolor`: For colored terminal output and banner display.

To install these dependencies, use:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
