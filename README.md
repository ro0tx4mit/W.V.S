# Web Vulnerability Scanner (W.V.S)

## Overview

**Web Vulnerability Scanner (W.V.S)** is a Python-based tool designed to identify and report security vulnerabilities on web pages. The tool scrapes specified URLs for vulnerabilities listed in a predefined table format, filters critical and high-severity issues, and generates a CSV report. If critical vulnerabilities are detected, an email notification is sent.

     W . V . S  -  Web Vulnerability Scanner
     Developed By: SUDO 3XPLOIT
     Version: 1.0

    Enter a URL to scrape for vulnerabilities (or type 'done' to finish):
```
## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts vulnerability data from HTML tables on specified web pages.
- **Severity Filtering**: Identifies and collects vulnerabilities classified as "Critical" or "High".
- **CSV Reporting**: Saves the collected vulnerability data in a CSV file for easy review.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends an alert via email when critical vulnerabilities are detected.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
project_root/
│
├── scrape_vulnerabilities.py  # Main script for scraping vulnerabilities and sending notifications
├── Banner/
│   └── banner.py  # Script defining the banner display
├── requirements.txt  # List of Python package dependencies
└── critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv (generated by the script)  # Report of detected vulnerabilities
```

## Installation

To set up the Web Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Email Configuration

- Open the `scrape_vulnerabilities.py` file and configure your email settings. You can either set environment variables or directly input your credentials:

  ```python
  from_email = os.getenv("EMAIL_USER")  # Environment variable for email
  password = os.getenv("EMAIL_PASS")    # Environment variable for email password
  ```

- Replace `smtp.example.com` with your SMTP server’s address and port.

### Banner Customization

- Modify the `Banner/banner.py` file to update the banner text displayed when the script runs.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```sh
   python scrape_vulnerabilities.py
   ```

2. **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**

   - Enter the URLs you want to scrape.
   - Type `done` when you have finished entering URLs.

3. **Review the Report:**

   - Check the `critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv` file for the list of detected critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.

4. **Email Notifications:**

   - If critical vulnerabilities are found, an email notification will be sent to the recipient specified in the script.

## Output

### Console Output

When running the script, you will see console messages indicating the progress of the scraping process:

- **Scraping Notification**:
  ```
  Scraping <URL>...
  ```

- **Added Vulnerabilities**:
  ```
  Added vulnerabilities from <URL>.
  ```

- **CSV Save Confirmation**:
  ```
  Critical vulnerabilities report saved as 'critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv'.
  ```

- **Email Notification**:
  ```
  Notification email sent.
  ```

### CSV Report

The CSV file `critical_vulnerabilities_report.csv` will contain columns for:

- **CVE ID**: The unique identifier for the vulnerability.
- **Description**: A brief description of the vulnerability.
- **Severity**: The severity level of the vulnerability (e.g., Critical, High).
- **Affected Products**: The products affected by the vulnerability.

Here is an example of the CSV file format:

```
CVE ID,Description,Severity,Affected Products
CVE-2024-1234,"Description of the vulnerability",Critical,"Product A, Product B"
CVE-2024-5678,"Another vulnerability description",High,"Product C"
```

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to web pages.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
- `pandas`: For handling and exporting data to CSV format.
- `termcolor`: For colored terminal output and banner display.

To install these dependencies, use:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
